    <h3 class="open-sans white lh-title f2 mt0 mb2 tc">What is Bridge for Software Development?</h3>
    <div class="tc center bg-green w3 pt1 mt3 mb3"></div>
    <p>Bridge is a free 11-week program that teaches advanced software development â€” you can think of us as a masterclass for becoming an in-demand developer. We meet in person twice a week, in small class sizes, to work on real-world projects and learn modern technical best practices from expert developers. Bridge goes beyond the typical classroom experience: our team is committed to providing a supportive environment where women, agender, and non-binary professionals can learn, ask questions, and build on their technical skills. At the end of the course you'll leave with greatly increased confidence, a project for your portfolio, and experience with highly-sought-after technologies taught by industry experts.</p>
    <p>
      In addition to our up to date technical content, weâ€™ll level up your confidence with interview practice, teach you the ropes of Agile product development, and give you a chance to take a project to production with a team so that you can confidently pursue your next challenge in software development and accelerate your career.

      <h1 class="open-sans blue lh-title f2 mt0 mb2 tc">Is Bridge for Software Development Right for You?</h1>
      <div class="tc center bg-green w3 pt1 mt3 mb3"></div>
      <p>The Bridge for Software Development Cohort is for women, agender, and non-binary developers who are looking to skill-up so that they can take on more challenging projects, get a new position at their dream company, and generally have more opportunity to do the work they most want to do.</p>
      <p>Bridge students come from all sorts of backgrounds. You might be working as a junior developer, doing development on the side, or doing a job in tech that just doesn't quite match up with what you really want to be doing. Maybe you're getting back into the world of programming and want to learn modern best practices, or you're a bootcamp grad that's looking to go from their first job in tech to a great job in tech. If this sounds like you, Bridge might be a good fit!</p>

    <h1 class="open-sans white lh-title f2 mt0 mb2 tc">Who Can Apply?</h1>
    <div class="tc center bg-green w3 pt1 mt3 mb3"></div>

    <p>Anyone who identifies with any, some, or all of these categories: women, non-binary, and agender people, and has some experience with coding; you're comfortable with programming basics but would like to advance your web development skills. For example, you might be a junior web developer, a self-taught mobile dev, someone who left development and wants to come back. As long as you have the desire to learn we welcome your application. <strong>If you're unsure you qualify, apply anyway!</strong>
    <p class="tl">Generally speaking, those accepted past the first round of our process fulfill the following criteria:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Are a woman, agender, and/or non-binary</li>
      <li>Are able to attend all classes in person in downtown Toronto</li>
      <li>Are able to commit the additional outside of class time for homework and project work</li>
      <li>Have some previous experience writing Javascript (answers to the technical test in Round Two must be written in JavaScript)</li>

     <h1 class="open-sans blue lh-title f2 mt0 mb2 tc">Who Gets Accepted to Bridge?</h1>
     <div class="tc center bg-green w3 pt1 mt3 mb3"></div>
     <p>Bridge has had many students accepted that didn't think they'd get in, and people who've applied several times before they were accepted. We encourage everyone to go through the process instead of self-selecting out &mdash; it's free to apply, and if you don't make it into this cohort you can apply again. We have a limited number of spots and we highly encourage everyone to keep learning and applying.</p>
     <p>Generally speaking, the students accepted into Bridge demonstrate that they can write simple, easy-to-read code, documented where necessary.</p>
     <p>There is no one type of person that gets accepted to Bridge, no one path, and no one way of writing code. Know that we're working as hard as possible to bring you as many cohorts as we can, raising the amount of people we can accept into our classes.</p>

    <div class="tc center bg-green w3 pt1 mt3 mb3"></div>
    <p>Our application process is in two parts: <strong>Part One</strong> is the <strong>general application</strong>, where we look for the above-mentioned criteria. Depending on number of applications other criteria may be considered. Those who continue to <strong>Part Two</strong> will receive a <strong>technical test</strong>, to be answered in JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Bridge will be open for Part One of our application process from <strong>July 16th - July 29th at 11:59pm</strong>. The Bridge team will look over every application we receive. Those who are selected for Part Two of the process will be contacted at the email you provided by <strong>August 6th</strong>, and sent a short technical test with instructions to submit. Once you receive the technical test you will be given one week (including the weekend) to hand it in for assessment by our instructors. All candidates who have been selected to join the next cohort will be contacted by <strong>August 20th</strong>. Class will commence on September 4th.</p>

  <p class="f4 blue i tc center">I had been learning front-end development on my own for a year and a half before Bridge, and while I'd been making steady but slow progress, Bridge was the ultimate accelerator of my career change. It was a feverish period of intensive technical learning and job hunt preparation that propelled me onto an interview-ready level, and within months from graduation I was working in the industry. It's called Bridge, but it was more like a Rocket, so prepare for take off!</p>
